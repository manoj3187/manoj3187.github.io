        <p>Stock Prediction Using NLP (<a href="https://github.com/manoj3187/Stock-Price-Prediction-with-Sentiment-Analysis" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>)</p>
        &#8226; Used NLP to predict stock prices of Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Amazon with a r2 score of
            0.72. <br>
            &#8226; Features used were derived using over 10 years’ worth of news data related to the 4 companies
            and world events (focused on the pandemic), previous stock data and Google trends data. <br>

            &#8226; Data acquisition, preprocessing and Predictive modelling was carried out by creating a pipeline
            on Google Cloud Platform. EDA was carried out using Tableau and Power BI. <br>
            &#8226; News data was converted into sentiment scores using NLP. !4 features were used to predict the
            stock prices using LSTM, Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression algorithms.

        <p>IMDB Ratings Predition(<a href="https://github.com/manoj3187/Spongebob-ratings-prediction" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>)</p>
        &#8226; Used Naïve Bayes algorithm to classify Sponge Bob episodes as ‘good’, ‘bad’ and ‘average’
        depending on the rating with an accuracy of 80%. <br>
        &#8226;  Features for each episode were derived by scraping transcripts of episodes from
Spongebob.fandom.com. <br>
&#8226; Mined text was then converted into sentiment scores for each character and writer of the episode
using NLP (sentiment analysis) <br>
&#8226;  Modelling and EDA was carried out using Spark and Tableau respectively

        <p>In-Game Chat Protocol(<a href="https://github.com/manoj3187/In-Game-Chat-Protocol" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>)</p>
        &#8226;  Built a chat protocol for the FIFA community using sockets in Python. <br>
        &#8226; The IGCP protocol allows gamers to chat with each other while making sure all participants adhere
        to community guidelines.

        <p>Analysis of Conditions Contributing to Covid-19 Deaths (<a href="https://github.com/manoj3187/Analyzing-the-conditions-contributing-to-Covid-19-Deaths" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>)</p>
        &#8226; Combined a CDC Covid-19 dataset and a public health dataset to study the effects of statewide
features such poverty and literacy rates (among other features), medical conditions, age groups
and mask mandate on Covid-19 fatalities. <br>
&#8226; Used python and Weka to explore patterns and see how each of the features lined up in
contributing to Covid-19 fatalities. <br>
&#8226; Performed feature selection and used the features to forecast Covid-19 fatalities with an r2 score
of 0.78 and mean absolute error of 0.3. Algorithms used: Linear regression, Support vector
regressor, Random Forest and decision tree regressor.

    <p>Sentiment Analysis of The Office, US(<a href="https://github.com/manoj3187/Sentiment-analysis-of-The-Office-US" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>)</p>
    &#8226; Scraped transcripts of all episodes from officequotes.net and converted the text data into
    numerical data using Vedar Sentiment analysis. <br>
    &#8226; Sentiment scores were assigned to every character for every episode based on dialogues and
    scene description. <br>
