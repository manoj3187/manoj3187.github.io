        <p class="subheadings7">HI! I am Manoj, an aspiring Data Scientist who loves using Big Data technologies to solve real-world problems.</p>
        <img id="football" src="./homepic.jpeg" alt="">
        <p class="subheadings8">About me:</p>
        <p class="minor4">I am a graduate student pursuing an MS in Computer Science at the College of Computing and Informatics, Drexel University. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Data Science as well. Originally from India, I moved to the US almost 3 years ago to study at Drexel. I enjoy working on Data Science projects, I'm always trying to come up with problems that could be solved by analyzing data. In my free time I play FIFA, read books and watch tv shows. </p>
        <p class="subheadings8">Research Interests:</p>
        <p class="minor5">At CCI, I've had the pleasure of working with and learning from researchers who have had years of experience in the field of Health Informatics. The idea of using data to solve problems in the field of Healthcare and Medicine fascinates me. Although I graduate soon and will start looking for full time jobs starting January 2022, I would like to go back to school some day and pursue a PhD with a research focus in Health Informatics.</p>
